There are two manuscripts associated with this datathon. The first, by Toczdlowski et al. 2021, can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2107934118). The code for this manuscript can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/toczydlowski/status_of_insdc_genomic_metadata/src/master/)


The second manuscript, Crandall et al., is currently a pre-print [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.12.507034v1). The code for the datathon and analyses underlying this second paper can be found within this github repositorty. Code in Datathon_Data_Wrangling.qmd is by Eric Crandall. Code within the directory scripts_datathon1_Toczydlowski is by Rachel Toczydlowski. Cod in logistic_models_Bradburd is by Gideon Bradburd.

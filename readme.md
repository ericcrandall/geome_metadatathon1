# Metadatathon Code

Code and meta-metadata that support analyses for the great Genomic Observatories Metadatabase (geome-db.org) metadatathon of 2020. 

Eric Crandall's code for setting up the datathon, creating a list of non-wild species to filter the SRA data, making a tree of all datathon species, and other code can also be viewed as a Quarto Notebook here[here](https://ericcrandall.github.io/geome_metadatathon1/Datathon_Data_Wrangling.html)

There are two manuscripts associated with this datathon. The first, by Toczdlowski et al. 2021, can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2107934118). The code for this manuscript can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/toczydlowski/status_of_insdc_genomic_metadata/src/master/)


The second manuscript, Crandall et al., is currently a pre-print [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.12.507034v2). The code for the datathon and analyses underlying this second paper can be found within this github repository. Code in Datathon_Data_Wrangling.qmd is by Eric Crandall. Figure and analysis code within the directory results_scripts is by Rachel Toczydlowski, with the exception of 2-datathon_tree_figure, which is by Eric Crandall. Code in logistic_models_Bradburd is by Gideon Bradburd.
